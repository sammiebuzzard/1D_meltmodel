Title: A Mathematical Model of Melt Lake Formation on an Ice Shelf
Description: The matlab files contained here comprise a 1-D mathematical model of 
a surface melt lake on an idealised ice shelf. The model incorporates a calculation of 
the surface energy balance of an ice shelf, heat transfer through the upper ice shelf, 
the production and percolation of meltwater into the firn, the formation of ice lenses 
in the firn and the formation, development and refreezing of surface melt lakes on 
the ice shelf.
The model is described in detail in Buzzard et al. 2018 (Journal of Advances in 
Modeling Earth Systems).
This model was created using Matlab_R2015a
